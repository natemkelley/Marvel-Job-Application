            <h3>History of Spider-Man in the MCU</h3>
            <p>Peter Benjamin Parker is a high school student and a superhero with spider-like abilities, fighting crime as his alter ego Spider-Man. After receiving his abilities from a spider's bite, Parker chose to protect Queens from crime with his powers. Despite his best efforts to keep his identity secret from the world, he was found and recruited by Tony Stark in the Avengers Civil War, while gaining a new suit and technology in exchange for his help.</p>
            <p>Following the Clash of the Avengers, Stark allowed Parker to keep the suit for his time as Spider-Man. Later on he stumbled into a group of criminals led by the Vulture, who were creating advanced weapons from stolen Chitauri technology, and went on a quest to defeat their own leader in order to prove to Stark that he was worthy of being an Avenger. Only after defeating Vulture did Parker discover the true responsibilities of a hero. <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Spider-Man is not only extremely powerful in terms of abilities, but he is also fun to watch! He has all the hilarity of Deadpool without the low brow humor. Despite his nerdish fleenings, he still manages to have a hot girlfriend! Oh yeah... He can also kiss upside down if you are into that sort of thing. Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man does not wear underpants on the outside of his costume. </p>
            <p>Peter Parker also has one of the best origin stories ever. A regular kid with regular problems gets super powers thrust upon him within years of his father figure being murdered. That's pretty hard to beat. Lastly, Spider-man, inside and outside the MCU, fights some of the coolest villians.</p>
